# Solar System & Flight Simulator

My first real [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) project.

Click on individual planets to move the camera and focus on that planet.

Click on the UFO to switch to flight mode and fly around the solar system.

Use W/S to increase or decrease throttle. Use A/D to roll. Use the mouse to control yaw and pitch. Use space to stop and set the speed to 0.

Press the escape key at any time to reset the camera and switch the focus back to the Sun.

Visit the [GitHub Pages site](https://jarvisar.github.io/solar-system/) to access the latest deployment.
